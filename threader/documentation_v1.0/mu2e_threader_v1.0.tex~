\section{Goal}
We aim to design a robust and scalable device that can run thread through straws epoxied in a panel. Sense wire will be hot glued onto thread and pulled through each straw. We strive to do this in a safe, efficient, and reproducible manner.


\section{Device Overview}
There are two main components to the threader unit. The 'gun', which the user controls, is a pistol grip blow gun connected to nitrogen and various electronic components. A DC motor is housed on the gun, and spins the spool of the thread. A small hole in the tip of the gun allows the thread to pass through. The nitrogen blows the thread along, while the motor allows more thread to be released. There is a potentiometer with a custom attachment used to control the speed of the thread. A simple pushbutton allows the user to toggle the motor direction. \par
The gun has a plastic tube and Ethernet	 cable leading out of the base which go into the nitrogen cylinder and 'electronics box', respectively. The electronics box currently consists of a Arduino Micro which controls a Pololu Qik 2s9v1 dual serial motor controller. The potentiometer and pushbutton are wired into the Arduino, while the motor is wired into the output of the Pololu. The electronics are powered by a rechargeable 12V battery. Everything is kept on a cart, but the cart is currently tied to the large nitrogen cylinder in the lab. See the future updates section for more information on plans to mobilize the cart. The first version of the cart is shown in figure~\ref{fig:full_cart}.

\end{figure}


\section{Basic Usage}




The Plexiglass speed control wheel is adjusted by the user each time the threader is used. The speed control wheel also controls whether the motor is on or off. Figure \ref{fig:speed} shows off and full speed positions of the speed control wheel.

\subsection{Threading}



\section{Gun Assembly}
DP-810 epoxy was used to secure the motor and other electronics onto the mount, but it would be much simpler and more effective to drill holes into the aluminum mount to properly mount the components. This should be done in the next iteration of the gun.
\subsection{}


\section{Circuit Assembly}
The prototype circuit was soldered onto a cheap prototyping breadboard and fixed into the plastic box from a discarded ethernet switch.

\section{Future Upgrades}
\begin{itemize}
\item{
\textbf{Printed circuit board (PCB):} The design of a PCB should make the circuit much sturdier and should cut down assembly time significantly. We can also slightly decrease the circuit's footprint. Note again that we would prefer a design that implements female header pins so the Arduino and Pololu boards can easily be swapped if anything breaks. Costs for a PCB are included in the cost analysis above, but the actually PCB still needs to be designed.
}
\textbf{Nozzle design:}
\item{
\textbf{High/Low Speed Switch:} There have been some concerns with the decrease in thread speed as the spool runs low (linear function of radius of the thread). If this problems significantly slows down threading, a simple pole switch (or button) could be added to the circuit to toggle between high and low speed settings. The low speed should be calibrated to work with a full spool, while the high speed would be calibrated to work well with a partial spool.
}
\item{
\textbf{On/Off LED:} It would be nice for the user to visually see when the box is turned on. Currently the switch is labeled on/off, but lights are a nice feature. This would be very cheap and easy to add to the circuit.
}
\item{
\textbf{Nitrogen on cart:} To make the cart fully mobile, we aim to find an easy way to put a smaller nitrogen tank on the bottom shelf of each cart. See Jason Bono for progress updates here.
}
\item{
\textbf{Toggle switch for motor direction:} While the button for motor reversal works fine, it can be argued that a user could easily forget to check which direction the motor is going before starting to use it. It may be more clear to add in a toggle switch to see on the gun itself which direction the motor is going at a given time.
}
\end{itemize}
