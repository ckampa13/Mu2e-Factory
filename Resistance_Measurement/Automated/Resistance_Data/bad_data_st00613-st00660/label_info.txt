File Flags:
-pre_fix1: there was a sorting error that caused straw IDs to assign to a random channel rather than in order...this data may be meaningless...caution!
	-fix1 date: 9/28/17
-ADJUSTED_CALIB took place during testing/initally finding fix1 issue

Note: I improperly sorted the 9-20 data after the fact (11/17), so this set is very meaningless.
