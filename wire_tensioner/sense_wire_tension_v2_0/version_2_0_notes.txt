-Version 2 marks the transition from the actuonix actuator (controled by sending a pulse, similar to a servo)
  to a stepper motor. The finer linear resolution achieved by the stepper should allow removal of the weak spring.
  This simplifies the mechanical task of alignment (massive spring sags, precise angle of sense wire with comb unknown).
-Code side control of stepper is very different than for the old actuator, thus the push to version 2.
-Adding a calibration function to the main Arduino script so that on the fly or scheduled calibrations can occur
  without having to change the code.
